## Definition

- "#yourip" means any of the following:

	- the IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg `192.168.1.10`)
	- the multicast domain name of your Raspberry Pi (eg `iot-hub.local`)
	- the domain name of your Raspberry Pi (eg `iot-hub.mydomain.com`) 

## About *Portainer CE*

*Portainer CE* (Community Edition) is an application for managing Docker. It is a successor to *Portainer*. According to [the *Portainer CE* documentation](https://www.portainer.io/2020/08/portainer-ce-2-0-what-to-expect/)

> Portainer 1.24.x will continue as a separate code branch, released as portainer/portainer:latest, and will receive ongoing security updates until at least 1st Sept 2021. No new features will be added beyond what was available in 1.24.1.

From that it should be clear that *Portainer* is deprecated and that *Portainer CE* is the way forward.

## *Portainer CE* coexistence with *Portainer*

IOTstack has been set up so that *Portainer CE* and *Portainer* can coexist. This is intended as a short-term migration aid rather than a long-term proposition.

If you are a first-time user of IOTstack, you should choose *Portainer CE* and forget about *Portainer*.

## Installing *Portainer CE*

Run the menu:

```
$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ ./menu.sh
```

Choose "Build Stack", select "Portainer-ce", press [TAB] then "\<Ok\>" and follow through to the end of the menu process, typically choosing "Do not overwrite" for any existing services. When the menu finishes:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Ignore any message like this:

> WARNING: Found orphan containers (portainer) for this project â€¦

### <a name="MigrationNote"> Migration note </a>

*Portainer CE* and *Portainer* use different locations for their persistent data:

Edition      | Persistent Data Directory       | Reference
-------------|---------------------------------|:---------:
Portainer    | ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer    | [A]
Portainer CE | ~/IOTstack/volumes/portainer-ce | [B]

If you have been running *Portainer* but have **never** run *Portainer CE* then:

* [A] will exist, but
* [B] will not exist.

Whenever "Portainer-ce" is enabled in `menu.sh`, a check is made for the **presence** of [A] combined with the **absence** [B]. If and only if that situation exists, [B] is initialised as a copy of [A].

This one-time copy is intended to preserve your *Portainer* settings and admin user password for use in *Portainer CE*. Thereafter, any settings you change in *Portainer CE* will not be reflected in *Portainer*, nor vice versa.

## Port Number = 9002

Both *Portainer CE* and *Portainer* are usually configured to listen to port 9000 but, in the IOTstack implementation:

* *Portainer CE* uses port 9002; and
* *Portainer* uses port 9000.

> You can always change the port numbers in your `docker-compose.yml`.  

## First run of *Portainer CE*

In your web browser navigate to `#yourip:9002/`.

* If you are migrating from *Portainer*:

	- review the [Migration note](#MigrationNote) which explains why your *Portainer* credentials will likely apply to *Portainer CE*, and then
	- supply your *Portainer* credentials.

* <a name="NewAccount"> If you are **not** migrating from *Portainer*: </a>

	- the first screen will suggest a username of "admin" and ask for a password. Supply those credentials and click "Create User".
	- the second screen will ask you to select a connection method. For IOTstack, "Docker (Manage the local Docker environment)" is usually appropriate so click that and then click "Connect".

From there, you can click on the "Local" group and take a look around. One of the things *Portainer CE* can help you do is find unused containers but beware of reading too much into this because, sometimes, an "unused" container is actually the base for another container (eg Node-Red).

There are 'Quick actions' to view logs and other stats. This can all be done from terminal commands but *Portainer CE* makes it easier. 

## Ceasing use of Portainer

As soon as you are happy that *Portainer CE* meets your needs, you can dispense with *Portainer*. IOTstack only has limited support for getting rid of unwanted services so you should do the following.

1. Stop Portainer from running and remove its image:

	```
	$ cd ~/IOTstack
	$ docker-compose stop portainer
	$ docker-compose rm -f portainer
	$ docker rmi portainer/portainer
	```
	
2. Either:

	- run `menu.sh`
	- choose "Build Stack"
	- de-select "portainer", and
	- follow through to the end choosing "Do not overwrite" for existing services,

	or:
	
	- edit `docker-compose.yml` and remove these lines:

		```
		  portainer:
		    container_name: portainer
		    image: portainer/portainer
		    restart: unless-stopped
		    ports:
		      - "9000:9000"
		    volumes:
		      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
		      - ./volumes/portainer/data:/data
		```
		
	- edit `services/selection.txt` and remove this line:
	
		```
		portainer
		```
	
3. Tidy-up:

	```
	$ cd ~/IOTstack
	$ rm -rf ./services/portainer
	$ sudo rm -rf ./volumes/portainer
	```
	
## Setting the Public IP address for your end-point

If you click on a "Published Port" in the "Containers" list, your browser may return an error saying something like "can't connect to server" associated with an IP address of "0.0.0.0".

To fix that problem, proceed as shown below:

![Set Public IP address](./images/portainer-ce-set-public-ip.png)

1. Click "Endpoints" in the left hand panel.
2. Click the name "local" in the list of Endpoints.
3. Click in the "Public IP" field. Enter one of the following:
	- The multicast DNS (MDNS) name of your Raspberry Pi (eg `iot-hub.local`)
	- The fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) of your Raspberry Pi (eg `iot-hub.mydomain.com`)
	- The IP address of your Raspberry Pi (eg `192.168.1.10`)
4. Click "Update endpoint".

> To remove the Public IP address, repeat the above steps but clear the "Public IP" field in step 3.

The reason why you have to tell *Portainer CE* which Public IP address to use is because an instance of *Portainer CE* does not necessarily have to be running on the **same** Raspberry Pi as the Docker containers it is managing.

Keep in mind that clicking on a "Published Port" does not guarantee that your browser can open a connection. For example:

* Port 1883 for Mosquitto expects MQTT packets. It will not respond to HTTP, so any attempt will fail.
* Port 8089 for PiHole will respond to HTTP but PiHole may reject or mis-handle your attempt.
* Port 1880 for NodeRed will respond normally.

> All things considered, you will get more consistent behaviour if you simply bookmark the URLs you want to use for your IOTstack services.

## If you forget your password

If you forget the password you created for *Portainer CE*, you can recover by doing the following:

```
$ cd ~/IOTstack
$ docker-compose stop portainer-ce
$ sudo rm -r ./volumes/portainer-ce
$ docker-compose start portainer-ce
```

Then use your browser to navigate to `#yourip:9002/` and follow the steps in [if you are **not** migrating from *Portainer*](#NewAccount).
